# Sort
In this exercise you are supposed to do some sorting of integers.

## Input

The first line of the input contains the number $t \leq 10$ of test
cases. Each of the $t$ test cases is described as follows.

-   It starts with a line that contains an integer `n`, such that $0
          \leq n \leq 10^5$.

-   The following line contains $n$ integers $\verb|a|_0\ \ldots\
          \verb|a|_{n - 1}$, separated by a space, such that
    $-1000 \leq a_i \leq
          1000$, for all $i \in \{0, \ldots, n - 1\}$.

-   The following line contains an integer `x`, denoting whether the
    numbers should be sorted in a non-decreasing order or in a
    non-increasing order, and such that $x \in \{0, 1\}$.

## Output

For each test case output one line with the numbers sorted in a
non-decreasing order if $x = 0$, and in a non-increasing order
otherwise.

## Points 

There is one group of test sets, worth $100$ points in total.
