# Basic Data Types

In this exercise you have to read several basic C`++` data types and
output them to the standard output in the required format.

## Input

The first line of the input contains the number $t \leq 10$ of test
cases. Each of the $t$ test cases is described as follows.

-   It consists of four values, separated by a space. These values have
    different types, as given by the following order: `int`, `long`,
    `std::string`, `double`.

*Note:* You might want to use `long long` instead of `long` to store
large integers depending on your machine.

## Output

For each test case output one line containing all input data types,
separated by a space. Floating point numbers should be rounded up to $2$
decimal digits.

## Points

There is one group of test sets, worth $100$ points in total.
