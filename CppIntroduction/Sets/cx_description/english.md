# Sets
In this exercise you are supposed to do some operations with sets.

## Input

The first line of the input contains the number $t \leq 10$ of test
cases. Each of the $t$ test cases is described as follows.

-   It starts with a line that contains an integer `q`, such that $0
          \leq q \leq 10$.

-   The following $q$ lines each contain two integers `a b`, separated
    by a space, such that $a \in \{0, 1\}$ and $-1000 \leq b \leq
          1000$, in one of the following forms:

    -   `0 b`: add the element $b$ to the set;

    -   `1 b`: delete the element $b$ from the set.

## Output

For each test set output one line with the remaining elements of the set
separated by a space. If there are no elements remaining in the set
output '`Empty`'.

## Points

There is one group of test sets, worth $100$ points in total.
