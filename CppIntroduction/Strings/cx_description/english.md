# Strings

In this exercise you practise some operations on strings.

## Input

The first line of the input contains the number $t \leq 10$ of test
cases. Each of the $t$ test cases is described as follows.

-   It consists of a line that contains two strings `a b`, separated by
    a space, and such that their individual length is at most $10$.

## Output

For each test case output three lines.

-   The first line contains two integers, separated by a space,
    representing the length of $a$ and $b$, respectively.

-   The second line contains a string obtained by concatenating the
    given strings $a$ and $b$.

-   The third line contains two strings `c` and `d`, where $c$ and $d$
    are obtained by first reversing the strings $a$ and $b$ and then
    swapping the first characters of the newly obtained strings.

## Points

There is one group of test sets, worth $100$ points in total.
