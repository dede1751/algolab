# Build the Sum

Given $n \geq 1$ integers $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n - 1}$, calculate the
sum $\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} a_i$.

## Input

The first line of the input contains the number $t \leq 10$ of test
cases. Each of the $t$ test cases is described as follows.

-   It starts with a line that contains an integer $n$, denoting the
    number of integers to sum up, such that $0 \leq n \leq 10$.

-   The following line contains $n$ integers $\verb|a|_0\ \ldots\
          \verb|a|_{n - 1}$, separated by a space, such that
    $-1000 \leq a_i \leq
          1000$, for every $i \in \{0, \ldots, n - 1\}$.

## Output

For each test case output one line with a single integer that denotes
the required sum.

## Points

There is one group of test sets, worth $100$ points in total.
